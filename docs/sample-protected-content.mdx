<h3 id="inverse-kinematics">Inverse Kinematics</h3>

Inverse kinematics (IK) is a mathematical process that calculates the joint angles required to position the end effector of a robotic arm at a specific location. This is crucial for tasks like grasping objects, path planning, and manipulation.

<h3 id="control-theory">Control Theory</h3>

Modern robotics relies heavily on control systems to manage robot behavior. PID controllers, state-space models, and adaptive control algorithms form the foundation of responsive robotic systems.

<h3 id="slam-simultaneous-localization-and-mapping">SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)</h3>

SLAM algorithms allow robots to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of their location within that map. This is essential for autonomous navigation.
